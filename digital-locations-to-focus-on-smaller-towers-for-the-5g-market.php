        <h3>DIGITAL LOCATIONS TO FOCUS ON SMALLER TOWERS FOR THE 5G MARKET</h3>
        <span>DECEMBER 5TH, 2019</span>
        <h2>Due to the technical need to place 5G “small cells” every few hundred feet, the Company expects demand for smaller towers to grow exponentially.</h2>
        <p>Santa Barbara, CA – December 5, 2019 – Digital Locations, Inc. (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dloc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLOC</a>), a developer of cell tower sites for the 5G revolution, today announced that it intends to initially focus on smaller towers built specifically for 5G networks.
        </p>
        <p>5G operates on a much higher electromagnetic frequency spectrum than previous mobile networks.  The wavelengths it sends out have a higher capacity but a shorter range, which means that large towers that serve dozens of square miles won’t be effective.  To make the network effective, “small cells” will have to be placed every few hundred feet.</p>

        <p>Rather than large traditional towers, these small cells will rely on “poles” or even existing streetlights and utility poles. Because 5G small cells cover a much shorter distance, there will eventually have to be more of them – thus the demand for a tremendous number of freestanding poles.  Also, each pole may only house technology for one mobile carrier.  As a result, the demand for poles could grow exponentially.</p>

        <p>“We expect that the 5G network will make cellular data connections 100 times faster than what we have today,” said Bill Beifuss, the Company’s President.  “This is so fast that you could download a two-hour movie in less than 3.4 seconds – compared to about six minutes on the 4G network. To make all this work, the US must build an incredible number of small towers – perhaps as many as two million new towers.”</p>


        <h2>About Digital Locations, Inc.</h2>
        <p>Digital Locations is a developer of cell tower sites for the 5G revolution.  5G wireless networks are expected to be 100 times faster than current 4G LTE networks.  This will enable global scale killer applications such as self-driving cars, the Internet of things (IOT), mobile streaming of 4K videos, real-time hologram-based collaboration and lag-free high definition gaming.  To realize this vision, many new 5G broadcast locations are needed because high frequency 5G signals cannot travel more than 100 meters.  It is estimated that more than 1 million new 5G cell towers must be added in the United States alone.  To rapidly enter the market, Digital Locations plans to partner or co-develop a portfolio of cell tower sites to help meet the demand of 5G networks.  Our goal is to become a “landlord” of tomorrow’s wireless communications assets.</p>
