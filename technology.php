                    <h3>It is Possible</h3>
                    <p>As demonstrated by the iPhone 14, it is possible for small devices to communicate directly with satellites high up in the sky. But only for text messages in case of an emergency, and only under the open sky with minimal obstructions. This is because current smartphone antennas and link protocols were not designed for high bandwidth and resilient satellite communication.</p>

            <h3>SATENNA<sup>TM</sup> – A NOVEL APPROACH</h3>
            <p>We intend to overcome this technical challenge by developing SatennaTM, a breakthrough technology that only requires modifications on the smartphone side. This breakthrough can potentially eliminate the need to make costly and time-consuming modifications to existing, as well as future satellites. SatennaTM will make it possible for device manufacturers, wireless carriers, and satellite operators to offer high-speed Internet service from satellites directly to smartphones, indoors and outdoors with no dead zones and no cell towers. We are redesigning the link technology between satellites and smartphones, from the ground up, with state-of-the-art features such as:</p>

            the new frontier</h3>
        <div class="frontier__text">
            <p>Satellite broadband Internet has been around for decades. However, the service is slow, expensive, data limited, and requires large receiver dishes mounted on fixed locations. These challenges are due to the inherent limits of older generation, gigantic and expensive satellites high up in geostationary Earth orbit (“GEO”), or even medium Earth orbit (“MEO”).</p>

            <p>Thanks to a new generation of visionary space companies such as SpaceX (Elon Musk) and Blue Origin (Jeff Bezos), the cost of launching satellites into space has come down dramatically through reusable rocket technology and more frequent space missions. As a result, it is now possible to deploy small, low-cost satellites that are in low Earth orbit (“LEO”). Closer to Earth means faster data transmission. However, it’s still very expensive and still needs special large receiver dishes mounted on fixed locations.</p>
