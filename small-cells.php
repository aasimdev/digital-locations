        <p>The fundamental laws of physics dictate that the higher the frequency, the shorter can travel. As a result, the super high speeds that 5G dreams are made of are only possible with the massive deployment of new sites.It is estimated that more than 1 million new 5G cell sites must be added in the united stated alone. By comparison, there are only about 350,000 large cell towers (macro-towers) in the United Started today. While these macro-towers can provide backhaul connection to small 5G networks, they are not close enough to the actually deliver high speed 5G.</p>

        <p>The FCC expects up to 80% of new cell site deployments will be small cells. That is because small cells are the only way for operators to deploy 5G in the super high speed millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum. Transmissions in mmWave spectrum can only travel a few hundred feet, due to the propogation characteristics of that band, and that is ideal for small cells simply because they can be as small as a pizza box and are often installed on building roof tops, store fronts and so-called “street furniture” like light poles or streetlights.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">Wireless operators will look to small cell technology to add data capacity in areas of traffic congestion. A dense small cell network both increases the radios per subscriber improved signal quality for more efficient data transsfer. The shorter distance between small cell sites also helps overcome the short signal reach of higher frequency 5G radio spectrum. As a result, small cells are becoming the leading solution in growing the data capacity of the network, as well as increasing the speed.</p>

        <p>All these factors create a very large market for small cells and a substantial opportunity for Digital Locations.</p>
        <p>To minimize upfront capital costs, Digital Locations plans to enter into lease option agreements with building/property owners. Once an Adequate number of sites have been secured in a particular area (perhaps 20-25 locations in a square mile area), the company will enter into rental agreements with one or more wireless operators desiring to extend 5G coverage in the area, such as Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile Sprint.
